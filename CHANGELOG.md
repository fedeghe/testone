## @fedeghe/testone changelog <sub><sub>from version 0.2.6</sub></sub>

- 0.2.7:  
    - removed gc, not that relevant (on the long run the gc noise gets nulled)  
    - now Testone is isomorphic, the only thing for the moment one cannot get in the browser are the `mem` related stuff  
    in reports and clearly also in the metrics.
- 0.2.6: added `ops` field in result
