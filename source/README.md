## testone (v. $PACKAGE.version$)

Quickly test performance and correctness of one or more functions against input/output data.  

```
testone(
    *ios <[literal object]>,
    *strat <Æ’n OR [Æ’n]>
    options <literal object>
);
```
where:
- `io` is a simple object literal composed by:  
    - `in` keyed element which can be either
        - array for the function inputs 
        - a function supposed to return an array to be used as input values
    - `out` keyed element which can be either
        - a static value  
        - a function that will receive what is returned from the strategy (plus io index and iteration)  
        and it's supposed to return a _boolean_ representing the test outcome
- `strat` the function of the array of functions one wants to check


``` js 
const pow = (d, n) => d ** n,
    powN = (d, n) => Math.pow(d, n),
    ios = [{
        in: [2, 3],
        out: 8
    },{
        in: [4, 3],
        out: 64
    },{
        in: (ioIndex, iteration) => {
            return [ioIndex, iteration]
        },
        // in case a function is specified
        // will receive the whole result (+ io index and iteration)
        // and is expected to return true
        out: (r, ioIndex, iteration) => r === ioIndex ** iteration
    }];

// one function or an array of functions to test
var res = testone(ios, [pow, powN], {iterations: 1e6});
```

and `res` will contain something like: 

``` json 
{
  "times": { "powN": "770 ns", "pow": "859 ns" },
  "passing": { "pow": true, "powN": true },
  "mem": { "pow": "0.1533 B", "powN": "0.3801 B" },
  "rank": [ "powN", "pow" ],
  "fx": { "powN": 0.00029265544, "pow": 0.000131715624 }
}
```

here `fx`   
aims to give an extended quick metric considering the `memory employed * time spent`

---
### Iterations (1k default)
To get a more accurate times & memory measurerements by default _testone_ runs each function 1k times  
but clearly enough this could not fit some all cases (exactly as above). 

For this reason is possible to specify in the third `options` literal object an integer parameter keyed `iterations`
